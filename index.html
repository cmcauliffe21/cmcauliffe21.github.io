          <p> <font size="6">Biography </font></p>
          <p> <font size="3"> I am currently in my freshman year at The Ross School. I am living in East Hampton, NY where I live with four others in my family and about five different pets. I have been at the Ross School for about four years now and I have been lucky enough to be a part of Innovation lab at Ross. Ilab has expanded my understanding of building and making in all different variations. The opportunities in Ilab have really helped. For example, I built a 3D printer kit in the span of three weeks based in one 45 minute classes per day. I completed this project the first term of Ilab and this really gave me building blocks to grow my building skills. Before my family decided to move out of the city I was going to a traditional elementary school in Manhattan and I could never go back. I went through 3 different schools while we were living in this borough and none of them really stood out to my learning style.  My parents finally decided enough was enough because they did not see me succeeding as well as if I were out in the country where I belonged. I had always had a huge passion for the outdoors and everything nature has to offer. I had been tinkering and building with engines ever since I took apart an old Weedwacker. This was due because of my huge passion for remote controlled vechicles.
